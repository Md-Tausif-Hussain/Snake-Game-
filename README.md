# Snake Game 

This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI). Players control the snake using arrow keys to eat apples, grow in length, and avoid obstacles. The game features sound effects, score tracking, and options to enable or disable sound.

▶ Features :               
◉ Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys.                     
◉ Apple Eating: Eat apples to grow the snake and increase your score.                      
◉ Obstacles: Avoid randomly placed obstacles to prevent the game from ending.                      
◉ Scoreboard: Displays the current score and final score upon game over.                     
◉ Sound Effects: Enable or disable sound effects for eating apples and game over.                    
◉ Wrap Around Option: Option to allow the snake to wrap around the screen edges.                              

▶ How It Works :                                       
The game is displayed in a 600x600 pixel window with a snake that moves in discrete steps. The game runs in a loop with a timer that updates the snake’s position and checks for collisions, apples, and obstacles.

▶ Controls :                              
◉ Arrow Keys: Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).                
◉ Enter Key: Restart the game after a game over.                  
◉ Space Key: Toggle sound effects on/off.
